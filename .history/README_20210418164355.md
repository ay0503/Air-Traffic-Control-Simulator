Background Knowledge:
This project is very specific in detailing in real word aviation. Many codes, and names are real names of airline, aircraft, airport, and procedures guided by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). This readme provides basic knowledge on the aviation procedures, names, and codes used in this program which should help the user play or even enjoy the game. Aviation vocabulary and abbreviations are referenced in the code to help the user better understand the objective of the code.

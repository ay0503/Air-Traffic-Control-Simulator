# Air-Traffic-Control-Simulator
# tp-atc

This project is an “Air Traffic Control Simulator” that simulates the real-world air traffic control radar from towers use to manage flights near airports. As a simulator, it mimics the verbal commands controllers use to direct aircraft while having the game aspect of having objectives of directing arrivals and departures. 

Features:
- intelligent airport, runway, flight generation for fresh gameplay
- autopilot features including ILS, glideslope, direct, headings
- verbal and non-verbal text based command recognition, handling, and execution for flights with  typo recognition
- weather engine with a wind map as well as storm features
- weather based airport, aircraft scenarios such as windshear, go-arounds, and closures
- aircraft identification features which special scenarios such as hijacking, maydays, pan-pan-pans

Background Knowledge:
This project is very specific in detailing in real word aviation. Many codes, and names are real names of airline, aircraft, airport, and procedures guided by the ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization). This readme provides basic knowledge on the aviation procedures, names, and codes used in this program which should help the user play or even enjoy the game. Aviation vocabulary and abbreviations are referenced in the code to help the user better understand the objective of the code.
